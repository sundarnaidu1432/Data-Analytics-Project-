# Data Analytics Project

Welcome to **Data Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project focuses on analyzing data of students enrolled in an institute to gain insights into registration trends, demo participation, and enrollment decisions. The dataset includes details such as student information, demo watched, and interest levels in joining the institute.

Using Power BI, the data was cleaned, transformed, and visualized to build an interactive dashboard that helps identify:
- Total students registered
- Students who attended demo sessions
- Students who were not interested in joining
- Monthly enrollment trends and engagement rates
- Gender-wise distribution and participation percentages
