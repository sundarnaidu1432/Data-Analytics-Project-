# Data Analytics Project

Welcome to **Data Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project focuses on analyzing data of students enrolled in an institute to gain insights into registration trends, demo participation, and enrollment decisions. The dataset includes details such as student information, demo watched, and interest levels in joining the institute.

Using Power BI, the data was cleaned, transformed, and visualized to build an interactive dashboard that helps identify:
- Total students registered
- Students who attended demo sessions
- Students who were not interested in joining
- Monthly enrollment trends and engagement rates
- Gender-wise distribution and participation percentages.

During the project, I identified data quality issues in the Age column, where some values were incorrect. To maintain data accuracy, I replaced the invalid ages with nearest values based on records. In real life project Discussions made by the teammates and then take approval from Team head And Data engineer to made changes.  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning and Transformation:  
**Changes made in Power Query to enhance data quality:**
- 🧩 Corrected data types (e.g., dates, numbers, and text)
- 🔄 Removed duplicates and handled missing values
- 🧮 Replaced invalid entries with nearest valid data
- 📅 Standardized date and text formats for consistency

### 🧠 Measures and Calculations:
**Created several DAX measures to calculate:**
- 👩‍🎓 Total Students Registered
- 🎥 Demo Attended Count
- 📊 Enrollment Conversion Rate
- 🚻 Gender-wise Percentage
- 📅 Monthly Trends
 
### 📊 Dashboard and Insights:
**Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard containing:**
- 🧾 Card visuals for key metrics
- 📈 Charts for monthly and gender-based analysis
- 🎯 Filters and slicers for user-driven insights
 
This project helped me enhance my data analysis, data handling, and Power BI visualization skills. I learned to create various card visuals and analyze patterns effectively to generate meaningful insights.
